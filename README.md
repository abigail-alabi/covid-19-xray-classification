# Covid-19 Chest X-ray Classification
Building a Convolutional neural network to differentiate an X-ray image of a person affected with Covid-19 with a healthy person

Context:
In response to the acute medical challenges associated with the outbreak, Deep Learning algorithms have started being employed for medical image classification to help with COVID-19 diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are one such solution used to identify COVID-19 directly from Chest X-Rays, to assist radiologists in medical analysis of the lungs by classifying patients depending on whether they're healthy, have viral pneumonia, or are affected by COVID-19.

Objective:
The project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network to differentiate an X-ray image of a person affected with COVID-19 from that of a healthy person or a person who has viral pneumonia (fever).
